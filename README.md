# sanbot-mcu-bridge

A C++ library and CLI to control the Sanbot Elf S1-B2 humanoid robot over USB, bypassing the original Android controller.

## The project

**This project is currently ins development - it's not ready yet!**

This project aims to create a comprehensive and easy-to-use CLI and library to control the Sanbot Elf S1-B2 from (almost) any device, fully bypassing the original Android board. This will be used in a project of mine called Sunny-Sanbot, which you can find on my GitHub profile.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Working packet send/receive to MCUs
- [ ] All commands from original robot mapped in CLI
- [ ] Audio & Camera bridge
- [ ] GUI control panel
- [ ] C++ library

## Notes from the dev

The sources for algorithms, addresses and commands are private, since I can't publish them as they're not open source (I pulled it from the firmware such that it's legal for me to reference where necessary but not use or share).

For AI usage info, see docs/codex-or-no(dex).md

This library had a Python predecessor. For more info, see docs/History.md.
